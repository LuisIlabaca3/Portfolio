Hello there friend !
I am a data professional with over eight years of experience spanning data science, data engineering, and analytics.
In my years in the workforce I have worked on many data related task that address the full data lifecycle from data 
ingestion and exploratory analysis and creating reports and vizuals to advanced model building and performance evaluation 
and deployment. 

My goal with this github is to give you an idea of my current Programming/Analytical skills - I would love 
for us to discuss any concepts around Mathematics Statistics or Programming.
